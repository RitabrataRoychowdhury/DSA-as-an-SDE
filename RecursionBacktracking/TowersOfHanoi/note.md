ðŸ—¼ Tower of Hanoi - Recursion
===========================

Problem:
---------
Move 'n' disks from source peg A to destination peg C using auxiliary peg B, following these rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Only the top disk of any rod can be moved.
3. A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk.

Recursive Strategy:
-------------------
To move n disks from A â†’ C:
1. Move n-1 disks from A â†’ B using C as auxiliary.
2. Move the nth (largest) disk from A â†’ C.
3. Move n-1 disks from B â†’ C using A as auxiliary.

Recursion Subproblems:
-----------------------
1. Move the smaller discs from A â†’ B using C  
   â†³ Think of this as isolating the largest disk.
2. Move the largest (nth) disk directly from A â†’ C  
3. Move the lower (previously moved) discs from B â†’ C using A  

Code Pattern:
-------------
void hanoi(int n, char A, char B, char C) {
    if (n == 1) {
        cout << "Move disk 1 from " << A << " to " << C << "\n";
        return;
    }
    hanoi(n - 1, A, C, B);                     // Step 1
    cout << "Move disk " << n << " from " << A << " to " << C << "\n";  // Step 2
    hanoi(n - 1, B, A, C);                     // Step 3
}

Time and Space:
---------------
- Moves required: 2^n - 1
- Time Complexity: O(2^n)
- Space Complexity: O(n) (recursion stack)

Mnemonic:
----------
"Move n-1 away â†’ Move the big one â†’ Bring n-1 back"

Example Flow (n = 3):
---------------------
hanoi(3, A, B, C)
â”œâ”€â”€ hanoi(2, A, C, B)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hanoi(1, A, B, C) â†’ Move 1 A â†’ C
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Move 2 A â†’ B
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hanoi(1, C, A, B) â†’ Move 1 C â†’ B
â”œâ”€â”€ Move 3 A â†’ C
â””â”€â”€ hanoi(2, B, A, C)
    â”œâ”€â”€ hanoi(1, B, C, A) â†’ Move 1 B â†’ A
    â”œâ”€â”€ Move 2 B â†’ C
    â””â”€â”€ hanoi(1, A, B, C) â†’ Move 1 A â†’ C
